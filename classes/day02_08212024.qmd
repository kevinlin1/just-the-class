## From last class

-   Think of your project topic!

-   Talk to us if you need data. Check out [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/), [this R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/agridat/index.html).

-   About R versus SAS, versus python...

-   [Assignment 1](https://jlacasa.github.io/stat705_fall2024/assignments/hw1) is due next Wednesday 28th.

## Intro to statistical modeling

### Mental checklist:

1.  What is the problem or question? (what is the objective?)
2.  How is the data generated?

### Short story

#### My dad wants to grow clover in our farm and has different species to pick from.

#### The data

We planted three different legume species and waited two months for them to grow.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(car)
```

```{r}
dd_lotus <- read.csv("data/lotus_part1.csv") %>% 
  transmute(species = factor(species), agb_g) 
summary(dd_lotus)
```

```{r}
dd_lotus %>% 
  ggplot(aes(species, agb_g))+
  labs(y = expression(Aboveground~Biomass~(g~plant^{-1})))+
  geom_boxplot()
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
dd_lotus %>% 
  ggplot(aes(agb_g))+
  labs(x = expression(Aboveground~Biomass~(g~plant^{-1})))+
  geom_histogram( fill = NA, color = "black")+
  theme_classic()+
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1, 
        panel.grid.major.x = element_line())+
  facet_wrap(~species)
```

## Data generating process

To the whiteboard!

## Fitting the model to data

Live R session

## For next class:

-   Read Chapter 2 from the book.

-   Think of your project topic!

-   Schedule a 15-min meeting and we can chat about your project.
